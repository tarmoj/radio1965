# project-description.md #8.2 (lines 393-397): once the recording is
# confirmed finished, move it to eccm.ee over ssh/rsync - backgrounded so a
# slow/stalled transfer can't block or risk timing out this hook (same
# reasoning as backgrounding ffmpeg itself in icecast_on_connect.sh), and
# doesn't delay the unpublish call below.
#
# Not relying on icecast2's own $HOME/.ssh (e.g. a "Host eccm.ee" alias in
# ~/.ssh/config with User/Port/IdentityFile resolved implicitly): `getent
# passwd icecast2` shows its home as /usr/share/icecast2, a root-owned
# package directory that gets reset on icecast2 upgrades/reinstalls - not a
# sane place to park a private key, and relying on it is what made
# `sudo -u icecast2 ssh eccm.ee` hang in the first place (no config, no
# known_hosts entry for icecast2 to use). Point ssh at a dedicated
# key/known_hosts under /etc/radio65-eccm-ssh (owned by icecast2, 600)
# via explicit flags instead, so this doesn't depend on icecast2 having a
# usable home directory at all.
